        <p>Current research interests in my lab cover broad topics of bioinformatics and computational systems biology, particularly focused on (1) deciphering genetic and epigenetic codes, (2) exploring master regulators for gene programming, (3) understanding dynamics of gene regulatory networks, (4) investigating interactions between small molecules and proteins/DNA/RNA, and (5) using machine learning to predict gene regulation and model binding activities of small molecules. Since 2007, I have been conducting studies in gene regulatory mechanisms from multiple dimensions, including transcription factor regulation, DNA methylation, alternative splicing, microRNA regulation, whole-genome nucleosome organization, histone modifications, and chromatin organizations. My lab also works on public domain data to integrate a wide variety of ‘-omics’ data sets to achieve comprehensive patterns of gene regulatory networks. As director of Collaborative Core for Cancer Bioinformatics (C3B) shared by Indiana University Simon Cancer Center and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, I now oversee the bioinformatics analyses and training through the C3B, while developing diverse cutting edge analyses on high-throughput data and next generation sequencing (NGS) data, such as RNA-Seq, scRNA-seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Whole genome/exome sequencing, and CRISPR/Cas9 among others. My lab has successfully collaborated with tens research groups from different universities and institutes to produce many high-impact peer-reviewed publications. Some significant results have become the cornerstones of new grants funded by NIH and other agencies. </p>
